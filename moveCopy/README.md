# Move and Copy Workshop

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the "Move and Copy Semantics" workshop, a project focusing on understanding and implementing move and copy semantics in C++. The project showcases the performance differences between these two operations by manipulating a large, dynamically allocated array of C++ Standard Library strings.

## Project Overview

In this workshop, I tackled the complexities of managing memory efficiently in C++ by comparing the performance of move and copy operations. Using a large dataset of strings, the project provides a clear view of how efficient memory management can optimize performance in C++ applications.

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this workshop, I demonstrated the ability to:
- Retrieve and process data from large text files using `std::ifstream`.
- Monitor and optimize performance using the `std::chrono` library.
- Implement and understand the implications of copy and move semantics in resource management.
- Enhance application performance through efficient memory usage and operation optimization.

## Technical Achievements

- **Efficient File Handling**: Implemented efficient data extraction mechanisms by reading large files line-by-line, significantly reducing memory usage and preventing memory leaks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilized `std::chrono` for precise performance monitoring, enabling the identification and optimization of time-critical operations.
- **Advanced C++ Memory Management**: Showcased advanced proficiency in C++ by implementing classes with both copy and move semantics, focusing on optimizing memory allocation and resource management.
- **Code Integrity and Documentation**: Maintained high standards of code documentation and integrity, ensuring clear, maintainable code with detailed comments explaining critical sections.

## Skills Gained

- **Advanced C++ Programming**: Gained in-depth knowledge of C++17 features, particularly move and copy semantics, and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
- **Performance Analysis**: Developed the ability to analyze and optimize software performance using modern C++ libraries and techniques.
- **Resource Management**: Learned sophisticated techniques for managing resources in high-load applications, focusing on minimizing overhead and enhancing execution speed.



## Compilation and Execution

To compile the project, use the following command:

```
/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

To check for memory leaks, run:

```
valgrind ./ws
```

## Testing

Test the application using the provided sample inputs by comparing the expected and actual outputs. Detailed instructions for testing and expected outcomes are documented within each module.

## Reflection

A detailed reflection on the learning process and the challenges encountered is included in the repository, offering insights into the significant performance improvements achieved through the use of move semantics over traditional copy operations.

## Conclusion

This workshop provided me with a solid foundation in memory management and performance optimization in C++, equipping me with the skills necessary to develop efficient and high-performance software applications.
